Computer vision is a field of study within artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on enabling computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. By mimicking the human visual system, computer vision algorithms aim to extract meaningful information, recognize patterns, and make decisions based on visual data.

This technology involves various processes, including image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, object detection, segmentation, recognition, and interpretation. It utilizes techniques like machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to analyze and interpret visual information.
